    "<p>The boot code is represented as a text file with one <em>instruction</em> per line of text. Each instruction consists of an <em>operation</em> (<code>acc</code>, <code>jmp</code>, or <code>nop</code>) and an <em>argument</em> (a signed number like <code>+4</code> or <code>-20</code>).</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>acc</code> increases or decreases a single global value called the <em>accumulator</em> by the value given in the argument. For example, <code>acc +7</code> would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at <code>0</code>. After an <code>acc</code> instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>jmp</code> <em>jumps</em> to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an <em>offset</em> from the <code>jmp</code> instruction; for example, <code>jmp +2</code> would skip the next instruction, <code>jmp +1</code> would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and <code>jmp -20</code> would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>nop</code> stands for <em>No OPeration</em> - it does nothing.  The instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>For example, consider the following program:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>nop +0\n",
    "acc +1\n",

    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>First, the <code>nop +0</code> does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (<code>acc +1</code>) and <code>jmp +4</code> sets the next instruction to the other <code>acc +1</code> near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, <code>jmp -4</code> executes, setting the next instruction to the only <code>acc +3</code>.
